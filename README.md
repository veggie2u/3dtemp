## 3DTemp
This is an IOT project with several parts. There are Sensor nodes that send their data to the Server that then sends the data to the cloud. Currently that is Adafruit IO. The web project can be deployed on Netlify and used to look at the data. 

### Web
This project is a React/Netlify site to see the temperature/humidity data.

### Sensor
This project is an arduino sensor node.

### Server
This project collects the data from the senseor and sends to the cloud.
